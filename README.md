In this exercise, you will practice working with functions, loops, conditional statements and switch statements to manage the bank account you created in the first exercise of the project using the bank account operations you implemented in the second exercise of the project.

The account can be either a generic, debit or credit one. The account’s operations can be withdrawals or deposits. You will use functions, loops, conditional statements and switch statements to manage the bank account’s withdrawals and deposits.
